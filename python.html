    <h4>Donegeon</h4>
    <p>Donegeon is a funny game I wrote when I was first learning Python years ago. It is a text based dungeon
       crawl, based around the random selection of adjectives.I rewrote the code recently, to practice proper
       coding form such as OOP. I ended up having a lot of fun with it again, and adding some new functionality.

    <h4>Dinner Ideas</h4>
    <p>This app uses sqLite and tkinter to create a GUI for a database that stores meal ideas. You can filter
      the recipies based on difficulty, type of protein or carb, cook time, and course.
