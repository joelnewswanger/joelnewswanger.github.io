    <h4>Penn State Master's in GIS</h4>
    <h5>Web GIS Dashboard for Water Quality</h5>
    <p>
        This was my capstone project for my Master's program in GIS at Penn State. 
        The project proposal was developed to address a real-life use case for my team in the drinking water quality lab
        The design reflects the actual user needs and resource constraints for this use case.

    <h4>Intro GIS Capstone</h4>
    <p>This project is from one of my first exposures to GIS. It is the capstone project from the Intro GIS class I took in undergrad.
        I decided to do a location suitibility analysis on places to live after graduation.
        In this class, and specifically this extended project as I delved into routing algorithms and computing techniques,
        I learned how complex and interesting GIS can be. I found not only where to physically go after graduation, but unknowingly,
        where my career interests would go.
